  -- MKEATAPI.ADD Ver.1.12 -- 

  Command Line Parameter
  Parameter definitions:

    [/V] = Verbose Mode
    Displays controller status and drive type during OS/2 initialization.

    [/A:n] = Adapter Number
    Adapter 0 has default parameters for the primary adapter.
    Adapter 1 has default parameters for the secondary adapter.

    [/P:nnn] = Base I/O Port Address (hex)
    This parameter overrides the default base I/O port address for the adapter
    indecated. The default I/O address for primary is (1F0) and for seconday
    is (170).
    If you will set this parameter, you should set /I: parameter.

    [/I:xx]  = IRQ level (dec)
    This parameter overrides the default IRQ Number for the adapter indecated.
    The default IRQ level for primray is (14) and for seconday is (15).
    If you will set this parameter, you should set /P: parameter.

    [/NI] = No Interrupt Mode( Polling Mode )
    When you use IDE HDD and ATAPI CD-ROM drive at the same adapter(primary or
    secondary), the MKEATAPI.ADD driver is automatically used this mode.

    [/IOR] = I/O Channel Ready Supported Mode
    For the adapter with I/O channel ready, the MKEATAPI.ADD driver can
    designate the fastest read mode.

  Examples:
    ; scan to primary and secondary adapter.
    BASEDEV=MKEATAPI.ADD /V

    ; scan to secondary adapter with I/O channel ready.
    BASEDEV=MKEATAPI.ADD /V /A:1 /IOR

    ; scan to another adapter(I/O address 1E8  IRQ 11) with I/O channel ready.
    BASEDEV=MKEATAPI.ADD /V /P:1E8 /I:11 /IOR

  CAUTION:
     OS/2 Warp has ATAPI CD-ROM filter driver(IBMIDECD.FLT). If problems occur
     using the IBMIDECD filter, you fix lines in your OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file has
     to be edited as follows:

       rem BASEDEV=IBMIDECD.FLT

     At the end of the file, add the following statement

       BASEDEV=MKEATAPI.ADD /V

     and copy to root directory on the OS/2 system drive.
     In this time, if the CR-ROM drive is attached as master to primary or 
     secondary, you should fix a line in your OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file has to be
     edited as follows:

       BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:x /I

     The /A parameter refers to the adapter number that the CD-ROM is attached
     to.The /I parameter indicates that the IBM1S506 driver should not attempt
     to initialize the adapter indicated.
