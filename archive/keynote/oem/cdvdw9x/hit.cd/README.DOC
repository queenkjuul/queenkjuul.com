*** Release Notes for HIT-IDE.SYS Ver.1.06d2 ***

1. General

   HIT-IDE.SYS is the device driver for DOS CD-ROM Extensions that supports 
   ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

2. Command line switches of 'HIT-IDE.SYS'

   (1) SYNTAX
   
    DEVICE = [x:][\dir\]HIT-IDE.SYS /D:(device name) [/N:(number of drives)]
             [/T:(drive type)] [/S:(base I/O address)] [/V]
             
   (2) Meaning of switches
   
       /D:(device name)		Specifies "Device Name".
       
       /N:(number of drives)	Specifies number of drives to be supported by
       				this driver.  Value 1 to 8 are valid.
       				If this switch is omitted, the driver will 
       				search connected drives.
       
       /T:(drive type)		Specifies the first drive type to begin to 
       				support.  
       				Definition of drive types are as follows:
       				
       				/T:   base I/O address    master/slave
       				---------------------------------------------
       				0     1F0h(primary port)  master
       				1     1F0h(primary port)  slave 
       				2     170h(2nd port)      master
       				3     170h(2nd port)      slave 
       				4     1E8h(3rd port)      master
       				5     1E8h(3rd port)      slave 
       				6     168h(4th port)      master
       				7     168h(4th port)      slave 
				
       				If this switch is omitted, it is the same as
       				/T:0.
       				
       /S:(base I/O address)	Change IRQ number to the specified base I/O
       				address.
       				
				base I/O           IRQ No.
				 address    without /S:    with /S:  
					     (default)	  (alternate)
				----------------------------------------------
				170h		15		10
				1E8h		12		11
				168h		10		9
				(1F0h)		(14)		(14)
	
	/V			Display installation information.

	/B			Use BIOS setting for data transfer. 
	

3. Examples of installation

	<Case 1> -- Using /N: and /T: switches together.  This setting 
		will reduce the loading time of the device driver.

		DEVICE = HIT-IDE.SYS /D:MSCD001 /N:2 /T:2
		
		-- Search beginning at /T:2 installing maximum 2 drives.
		
	<Case 2> -- Default is automatic search for all drives connected.
     
		DEVICE = HIT-IDE.SYS /D:MSCD001
		
		-- Install all drives connected to primary, 2nd, 3rd & 4th.

	<Case 3> -- Using /N: switch to limit the maximum number of drives.

		DEVICE = HIT-IDE.SYS /D:MSCD001 /N:2
		
		-- Install maximum of 2 drives while auto searching.

	<Case 4> -- Using /T: switch to change the start of automatic search.

		DEVICE = HIT-IDE.SYS /D:MSCD001 /T:2
		
		-- Search beginning at /T:2 (2nd port and master).

	<Case 5> -- Using /S: switch to use alternate IRQ numbers.
	
		DEVICE = HIT-IDE.SYS /D:MSCD001 /S:170,168
		
		-- Auto search all drives using alternate IRQ numbers
		   for 170 (IRQ 10) and for 168 (IRQ 9).   Use default 
		   IRQ numbers for others (1F0 IRQ 14; 1E8 IRQ 12).
		
	<Case 6> -- Using all switches together.
	
		DEVICE = HIT-IDE.SYS /D:MSCD001 /N:1 /T:2 /S:170
		
		-- Install only 1 drive starting search at 2nd port master.
		   Use alternate IRQ of 10 for 170.
